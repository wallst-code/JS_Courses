'use strict';

// Best Practices based upon ECMASCRIPT 6 (2015) most current - becareful of what you see on the web...Using these best practices will help you standout. 

/*

1. Add 'use strict'; at the top of every file and IIFE (can also use it in functions and classes). Avoid "sloppy mode".
2. Use "let" and "const" while avoiding "var". Prefer "const". Use "let" if variable will need to change during its lifecycle, otherwise use "const".
3. Naming camelCase for variables, functions, etc., and PascalCase for classes.
4. Use IIFE's when ever it makes sense - it almost always makes sense - you will use them a lot.
5. Just because you can does not mean you should.
6. Use a separate file or files your JavaScript. (The correct way to spell JavaScript is with the capital S.)
7. Use semi-colons always. It makes it more readable and might avoid some errors. 
8. Don't assume things. Defensive programming - expecting something to come along that will break this.
